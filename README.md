simple autoit script that was used by me to scrape x/y slices of the chronicles of elyria map, which i further composited into a big map.  
  
the resulting images are saved in a [scriptdir/x/y/images.png] folder structure.  
they aren't composited into a single image or anything, so additional steps must be taken to form a complete image.
